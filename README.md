# Mapping desaster risk using AI and aereal footage

Basic modeling for a image classification challenge, which was about classifying roof types in aerial footage for assessment of disaster risk, using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Status: Not completed, although preliminary results were quite good (see baseline-model-test).
