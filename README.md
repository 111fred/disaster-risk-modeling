# Mapping disaster risk using AI and aereal footage

Basic modeling for a image classification challenge which was about classifying roof types in aerial footage for assessment of disaster risk, using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Status: Started in 2019 & never completed due to time constraints. Preliminary results were ok-ish (see baseline-model-test).
